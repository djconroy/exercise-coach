# Insight Coach
Insight Coach is an Android app I created as an intern at the Insight Centre for Data Analytics in UCD. The app was used by participants in a study conducted by a researcher at Insight.

Insight Coach implements an adaptive coaching system for use in an exercise program for people with type 2 diabetes. The app allows users to record their exercise activity. Every week the user progresses to the next level of the exercise program if they have completed enough prescribed exercise sessions at the current level. The app schedules and sends notifications and reminders to users about their prescribed exercise sessions. These notifications are sent at the same times of day regardless of timezone changes or transitions in and out of daylight saving time.

I created the app using Material Design. Slides presenting screenshots of the app are available on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-conroy/).
